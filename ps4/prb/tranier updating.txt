Check the official PS4 Trainer twitter page for any updates later than the update date of the offline trainer.

1. download the official list.json file from:
http://ps4trainer.com/Trainer/list.json
Chrome: RightClick and save as list.json
FireFox: Click on the save button.


2. Open the downloaded list.json file and open the offline trainer list.json file.
NotePad++ recommended.

Scroll to the bottom of both files.

Copy and paste any new entries from the downloaded list.json to the bottom of the offline trainer list.json file.

Make sure to keep the formatting the same:
{
"name": "BorderlandsÂ® 3",
"title": "CUSA08025",
"version": "01.16",
"url": "./games/CUSA08025_01.16.json"
},
{
"name": "MediEvil",
"title": "CUSA12982",
"version": "01.02",
"url": "./games/CUSA12982_01.02.json"
}
]
}

NOTE! Each trainer entry is separated by }, but the very last trainer in the list must not end in a comma!! SEE ABOVE.


3. Check if any of the new CUSA jpg files already exist in the offline trainer:
Do a search in the offline trainer list.json for the CUSA number of the new trainers.
eg search for: CUSA12982
If you find any matching CUSA numbers then that means that there is already a CUSA jpg for that game
so you do not need to download a new jpg for that one.

If you do not find a matching CUSA then download the needed jpgs from:
http://ps4trainer.com/Trainer/img/CUSA16745.jpg


4. Download the new individual trainer json files for the missing games:
Look at the "url": part of the missing trainer in the download list.json

http://ps4trainer.com/Trainer/games/CUSA16745_01.01.json

Chrome: RightClick and save as list.json
FireFox: Click on the save button.


5. Check that you have downloaded the right amount of files.
If there were 4 new trainers on the ps4trainer website then you should have 4 new CUSAxxxx_xx.xx.json files.
The amount of CUSAxxxx.jpg files will depend on how many 'NEW' games that are not already in the list. (see step 3)

6. Update the offline trainer with the new files:
Copy the CUSAxxxx_xx.xx.json and CUSAxxxx.jpg files to the 'games' folder in the Offline Trainer folder.
Finally open the index.html file and update the date in the title with the date of the latest tweet with new trainers.


7. Check the update worked:
Open the Offline Trainer, search for the the new trainers and check that they open correctly.



BEWARE!! Sometimes ps4trainer.com overwrites trainers that he already had in his list by mistake.
To overcome this check each new trainer CUSA against your offline json list and check if there is already the same version of trainer in the list.

e.g:
If there is a new trainer for CUSA00002 v01.00 but one already exists.
download the new trainer json (CUSA00002_01.00.json) and rename it to (CUSA00002_01.00_2.json) and then make sure the URL for the new trainer in your list.json corresponds to (CUSA00002_01.00_2.json).
