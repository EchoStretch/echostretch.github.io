The kernel exploit for the PS4 8.0x firmware series is based on pOOBs4.
exfathax_pico.img is from pOOBs4. This is currently a work in progress.

steps:
* write the exfathax_pico.img file to a USB drive
    $ dd if=exfathax_pico.img of=/dev/<your USB drive>
* modify exploit.mjs to run rop/800.mjs:
    import('./code.mj') -> import('./rop/800.mjs')

loading the exploit:
* have the browser load index.html
* wait for the "insert USB" alert dialog to prompt you
* Wait for this console notification to pop up: "This USB storage device's file
  system is unsupported".
* close the "insert USB" alert dialog by clicking "OK"
* keep closing future alert dialogs
* once you reach a log saying "kernel exploit succeeded", you're done
